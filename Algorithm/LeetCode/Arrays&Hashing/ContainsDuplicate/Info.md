### 1. Using Sorting
- **Steps**:
    1. Sort the given array.
    2. Traverse the sorted array and check if there's any adjacent pair with the same values.
    3. If found, return true. Otherwise, return false.

### 2. Using HashSet
- **Steps**:
    1. Initialize an empty HashSet.
    2. Traverse the array.
    3. For each element, check if it's already present in the HashSet.
    4. If yes, return true.
    5. If not, add the element to the HashSet and continue.
    6. If the end of the array is reached without finding any duplicates, return false.

### 3. Using Nested Loop (Brute Force)
- **Steps**:
    1. Use two nested loops to compare each pair of elements.
    2. If any pair of elements are the same, return true.
    3. If no such pair is found after checking all possibilities, return false.

## Recommendations and Tips:
1. **Choice of Algorithm**: The best choice of algorithm depends on the size of the input and space constraints. If space is a concern, sorting might be a good approach. If speed is more critical and space isn't an issue, using a HashSet would be faster.
2. **Avoid Brute Force**: The brute force solution should generally be avoided unless the input size is very small, as its time complexity is not efficient.
3. **Watch out for Edge Cases**: Always ensure that the array isn't empty or has only one element before processing.
4. **Code Efficiency**: If using a HashSet, the loop can be terminated as soon as a duplicate is found, instead of traversing the entire array.
5. **Always Ask**: If given such a problem in an interview, clarify whether modifications to the original array (like sorting) are acceptable or not.
