## 1. Single Pass - Character Check

### Description
Iterate through the strings simultaneously and track the differences encountered. If you observe more than one difference (insert, delete, or replace), return false.

### Steps
1. If the length difference between both strings is more than 1, return false.
2. Initialize two pointers at the beginning of both strings.
3. Traverse both strings. If the characters at the current pointers don't match:
    - If this is the first mismatch, mark that a difference has been found.
    - If it's a second mismatch, return false.
    - Adjust pointers accordingly depending on which string is longer (or if they're the same length).
4. If you finish traversing both strings and have found at most one difference, return true.

## 2. Length Difference Check

### Description
Before delving into character comparisons, you first determine if the lengths of the two strings differ by more than 1. If so, they can't be one edit away, and you immediately return false.

### Steps
1. Calculate the difference in lengths of the two strings.
2. If the difference is more than 1, return false.
3. If the lengths are the same, check for one replacement.
4. If one string is longer, check for one insertion in the longer string or a deletion in the shorter string.

## General Advice for Similar Problems
1. **Edge Cases**: Always consider the edge cases. For instance, when strings are empty or when they are exactly the same.
2. **Optimization**: Always strive for the optimized solution. Brute force might be easier to think of, but optimized solutions like the "Length Check & Single Scan" often require only a bit more conceptual work but offer a lot more efficiency.
3. **Single Scan Philosophy**: In many string or array problems, if you find yourself doing multiple scans, consider if there's a way to get all the needed information in a single pass.
4. **Assumptions**: Don't make unnecessary assumptions about the input. For instance, the input can have spaces, be of different lengths, etc. Always clarify or handle such cases.
