# Zero Matrix Problem Solutions

Given a MxN matrix, if an element is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0. Below are the potential solutions for this problem:

| Rank | Method                | Difficulty (out of 10) | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
|------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 1    | Using Auxiliary Space | 3                      | O(MxN)          | O(M + N)         |
| 2    | In-Place Modification | 6                      | O(MxN)          | O(1)             |

## 1. Using Auxiliary Space

### How to Implement:

1. Traverse the given matrix, and for each cell that has a value of 0, record its row and column index in two separate lists (or arrays).
2. Once the traversal is complete, iterate through the list of rows and set all the cells in those rows to 0.
3. Next, iterate through the list of columns and set all the cells in those columns to 0.

## 2. In-Place Modification

### How to Implement:

1. Use the first row and first column of the matrix to serve as the "record" lists from the first method.
2. Traverse the matrix, and for any cell that is 0, set the corresponding entry in the first row and first column to 0.
3. After the traversal, go back to the first row and column to determine which rows and columns should be set to 0. Be cautious about the original values of the first row and column.

# Tips for Tackling Such Algorithms:

1. **Clarity**: Before jumping to solutions, clearly understand the problem statement and requirements.
2. **Simplicity**: Start with the brute-force solution, understand it thoroughly, and then try to optimize.
3. **Space vs. Time**: Often, there is a trade-off between space and time complexity. Determine what is more critical for the given problem context.
4. **Edge Cases**: Always consider edge cases, such as matrices with 0 rows or columns, or matrices with no zeroes at all.
5. **In-place Operations**: If space complexity is a concern, always look for ways to do in-place operations instead of using auxiliary space.
