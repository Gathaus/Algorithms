## Method Descriptions

### 1. Layer by Layer Rotation (In-place)

**How to implement:**
- The idea is to rotate the matrix layer by layer, starting from the outermost layer and working our way inwards.
- For a single layer, move elements one by one in the current ring.
    - Temporarily save the top row element.
    - Move the left column element to the top row.
    - Move the bottom row element to the left column.
    - Move the right column element to the bottom row.
    - Assign the temporarily saved top row element to the right column.
- Repeat this process for all elements in the current layer/ring.
- Move inward and repeat for the next layer until all layers have been rotated.

### 2. Using Extra Matrix

**How to implement:**
- Create a new N x N matrix to store the rotated values.
- Iterate through each cell of the original matrix. For each cell at `(i,j)`, place its value in the new matrix at `(j, N-1-i)`.
- Once all cells have been transferred, copy the new matrix values back to the original matrix.

### 3. Transpose and Reverse Rows (In-place)

**How to implement:**
- First, transpose the matrix. The transpose of a matrix is achieved by reflecting its values over its main diagonal (i.e., switch rows with columns).
- After the transpose, reverse the rows. Reversing each row will give the desired 90-degree rotation.

## Tips for Rotation Problems

1. **Visual Representation**: Draw out the matrix on paper. Visualizing the rotation can be immensely helpful.

2. **Edge Cases**: Always test your algorithm with small matrices (e.g., 2x2, 3x3) to ensure that it handles edge cases, especially for in-place solutions.

3. **In-place Rotation**: In-place solutions often involve careful swapping of elements. Ensure that you don't overwrite any element before you have had the chance to move it to its correct position.

4. **Modularize**: Divide the process into functions (e.g., a swap function, transpose function). This helps in making the code clean and easy to debug.

5. **Boundary Conditions**: Pay special attention to the boundaries of the matrix, especially when iterating. Off-by-one errors are common.

6. **Test with Different Inputs**: Ensure to test the solution with both square and non-square matrices. This helps identify any assumptions you might have unknowingly made.
