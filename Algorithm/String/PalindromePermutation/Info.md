### 1. Use a Hash Table (Count Characters)
To determine if a permutation of a string can be a palindrome, you don't actually need to generate every permutation. Instead, you can simply count the characters:

#### Steps:
- **Initialize a hash table**: Create a hash table to count the occurrence of each character in the string.
- **Count characters**: Loop through the string, and for each character, increase its count in the hash table.
- **Check for even counts**: At most one character can have an odd count for a string to be a permutation of a palindrome.
- **Result**: If the number of characters with odd counts is 0 or 1, the string can be rearranged into a palindrome.

### 2. Use a Bit Vector
If you don't want to use extra space proportional to the input size, a bit vector could be useful.

#### Steps:
- **Initialize a bit vector**: Create an integer with 0 value.
- **Toggle the bit at the character's position**: As you loop through each character in the string, compute its position (e.g., 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, etc.), then toggle the bit at that position in the integer.
- **Check the bit vector**: After processing the string, the bit vector will have at most one bit set to 1. This can be checked by `(bit_vector & (bit_vector - 1)) == 0`. If this is true, then the string can be rearranged into a palindrome.

### General Tips:
1. **Understand the Problem**: Before jumping into a solution, ensure you thoroughly understand the problem. In this case, understanding that you don't need to actually find the palindrome, but just determine if it's possible, is crucial.
2. **Optimize Space**: If the problem doesn't require you to return the palindrome, you don't need to store potential palindrome strings. A simple counter or bit manipulation can be more space efficient.
3. **Consider Non-Alphabetic Characters**: The provided example has spaces, and it's not limited to dictionary words. Always consider the full ASCII character set unless specifically restricted.
4. **Case Sensitivity**: In the given example, the string is not case sensitive ("T" and "t" are treated the same). Ensure you handle cases appropriately in your solution.
5. **Test with Various Inputs**: Before finalizing your solution, test it with various input strings, especially edge cases. For instance, strings with one character, no characters, or strings that are already palindromes.
